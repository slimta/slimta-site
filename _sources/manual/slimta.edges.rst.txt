Configuring the Edges
=====================

.. _python-slimta-lookup: https://github.com/slimta/python-slimta-lookup
.. _PROXY protocol: http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt

The next big section in ``slimta.conf`` is ``edge``, which allows you to setup
as many different inbound edge listeners as you need. In the ``edge`` section,
each key provides an arbitrary, free-form name for the edge, and the value is
a mapping with two required keys:

* ``type``: String

  Defines the type of edge. A known type must be given or an error will be
  thrown. The other keys in this mapping depend on the value of ``type``.

* ``queue``: String

  When messages are received by this edge listener, they are passed to this
  queue. The value of this queue is a name, which must correspond to a key in
  the top-level ``queue`` section.

When available, edges may also include a ``listener`` sub-section that uses
consistent options. This sub-section is defined as:

.. _slimta-listener:

* ``listener``: Dictionary

  This mapping defines how to open the listening socket. Available keys are as
  follows:

  * ``type``: String

    Defines the type of listening socket. Valid values are ``tcp`` , ``udp``
    and ``unix``. The default type is ``tcp``.

  * ``interface``: String

    For ``tcp`` and ``udp`` types, this setting defines the interface IP on
    which to bind. Examples are ``'127.0.0.1'`` to only listen locally, or
    ``''`` to listen on all interfaces. The default is ``'127.0.0.1'``.

  * ``port``: Integer

    For ``tcp`` and ``udp`` types, this setting defines the port on which to
    bind. The default port number depends on the type of edge.

  * ``path``: String

    For ``unix`` types, this setting defines the file path where the listening
    UNIX socket is created. There is no default value.

  * ``backlog``: Integer

    For ``tcp`` and ``unix`` types, this setting defines the size of the
    backlog of unaccepted connections. See the :meth:`~socket.socket.listen`
    method for more information. The default is ``256``.

.. _lookup-section:

Some options can use `python-slimta-lookup`_ to query an external source for
its data. These sections must have the following option:

* ``type``: String, required

  Defines the type of external data source. Valid values are ``redis``,
  ``sqlite3``, and ``config``.

Additional optional and required options depend on ``type``. See the class
definitions in :ref:`slimta.lookup.drivers <slimta-lookup-drivers>` for more
information on these options.

``smtp`` Edges
""""""""""""""

SMTP Edges produce an |SmtpEdge| object from the extra keys given in the edge
sub-section. These keys are:

* ``listener``: Dictionary

  This mapping defines how to open the listening socket. See the
  :ref:`listener sub-section <slimta-listener>` for information on its
  available keys. The default value for ``port`` is ``25``.

* ``hostname``: String

  This is the string presented as the machine's hostname in the SMTP banner
  message. By default, this will be the machine's FQDN.

* ``max_size``: Integer

  This is the maximum allowed size, in bytes, of incoming messages on this SMTP
  edge. Larger messages are rejected. By default, there is no size limit.

* ``tls``: Dictionary

  This mapping, which takes the same keys as the keyword parameters to
  :func:`~ssl.wrap_socket`, both enables and configures TLS encryption on this
  SMTP edge. By default, TLS is not enabled.

* ``tls_immediately``: Boolean

  Defines whether or not TLS should handshake immediately on connection, or if
  a socket is only encrypted if the user runs ``STARTTLS``. By default, sessions
  are only encrypted on ``STARTTLS``.

* ``proxy_protocol``: Boolean

  Defines whether or not connections to the edge will include a
  `PROXY protocol`_ header defining the original connection information. Only
  use this option when running behind a properly configured proxy.

* ``rules``: Dictionary

  This sub-section gives extra configurability in the internals of the SMTP
  edge. It has its own set of keys, all of which are optional:

  * ``banner``: String

    This string is presented to connecting clients as the SMTP banner message.
    It can contain ``{fqdn}`` or ``{hostname}`` to substitute in the respective
    information about the local machine. By default, a generic banner message is
    used.

  * ``dnsbl``: String

    Specifies a server that will be queried as a DNS blocklist. If a connecting
    client "hits" on the DNS blocklist, it is rejected outright. By default, no
    DNS blocklists are checked.

  * ``reject_spf``: List

    Specifies a list of SPF result types that are rejected in an SMTP session.
    Valid strings in the list are: ``pass``, ``permerror``, ``fail``,
    ``temperror``, ``softfail``, ``none``, and ``neutral``. By default, no SPF
    results are rejected.

  * ``reject_spam``: Dictionary

    Specifies a spam engine that will be used to reject message data that is
    considered spam before it is accepted for delivery. At the moment, only
    :mod:`~slimta.policy.spamassassin` is available, which takes optional
    ``host`` and ``port`` keys.

  * ``only_senders``: List

    Only the email addresses in this list will be accepted when given in the
    ``MAIL FROM:<>`` command from a client. By default, all senders are
    accepted.

  * ``only_recipients``: List

    Only the email addresses in this list will be acceped when given in the
    ``RCPT TO:<>`` commands from the client. By default, all recipients are
    accepted.

  * ``regex_senders``: List
  
    Like ``only_senders`` but compiles each value into a regular expression
    that each sender address is matched against.
    
  * ``regex_recipients``: List
  
    Like ``only_recipients`` but compiles each value into a regular
    expression that each recipient address is matched against.

  * ``lookup_senders``: Dictionary

    This section follows the :ref:`lookup section <lookup-section>`
    requirements. It will limit the allowed addresses to the ``MAIL FROM:<>``
    command to those with records in the external data source.

  * ``lookup_recipients``: Dictionary

    This section follows the :ref:`lookup section <lookup-section>`
    requirements. It will limit the allowed addresses to the ``RCPT TO:<>``
    command to those with records in the external data source.

  * ``lookup_credentials``: Dictionary

    This section follows the :ref:`lookup section <lookup-section>`
    requirements. The SMTP ``AUTH`` extension will check the external data
    source for the authenticating username, and look for the ``password``
    attribute. That password is verified against that field using
    :obj:`passlib.apps.ldap_context`, meaning it supports the ``{SCHEME}HASH``
    format.

``http`` Edges
""""""""""""""

HTTP Edges produce an :class:`~slimta.edge.wsgi.WsgiEdge` object that is then
configured to receive mail. It supports the following options:

* ``listener``: Dictionary

  This mapping defines how to open the listening socket. See the
  :ref:`listener sub-section <slimta-listener>` for information on its
  available keys. The default value for ``port`` is ``8025``.

* ``hostname``: String

  This is the string presented as the machine's hostname in the SMTP banner
  message. By default, this will be the machine's FQDN.

* ``uri``: String

  This option defines a regular expression pattern that request paths must
  match, or a ``404 Not Found`` will be returned. If it is not given, all paths
  are accepted.

* ``tls``: Dictionary

  This mapping, which takes the same keys as the keyword parameters to
  :func:`~ssl.wrap_socket`, both enables and configures TLS encryption on this
  HTTP edge. All inbound requests must be HTTPS. By default, TLS is not
  enabled.

* ``rules``: Dictionary

  This sub-section gives extra configurability in the internals of the HTTP
  edge. It has its own set of keys, all of which are optional:

  * ``only_senders``: List

    Only the email addresses in this list will be accepted when given in the
    ``X-Envelope-Sender`` header from a client. By default, all senders are
    accepted.

  * ``only_recipients``: List

    Only the email addresses in this list will be acceped when given in the
    ``X-Envelope-Recipient`` headers from the client. By default, all
    recipients are accepted.

  * ``lookup_senders``: Dictionary

    This section follows the :ref:`lookup section <lookup-section>`
    requirements. It will limit the allowed addresses in the
    ``X-Envelope-Sender`` header to those with records in the external data
    source.

  * ``lookup_recipients``: Dictionary

    This section follows the :ref:`lookup section <lookup-section>`
    requirements. It will limit the allowed addresses in the
    ``X-Envelope-Recipient`` header to those with records in the external data
    source.

``custom`` Edges
""""""""""""""""

Only one additional key is required by the ``"custom"`` edge type:

* ``factory``: String, required

  This is a string of the form ``package.module:symbol``. The package and
  module portion are imported with :func:`importlib.import_module`, and then
  the symbol is fetched from the loaded module with :func:`getattr()`.

  The result of loading the symbol must be a function that takes two arguments,
  the options object (that contains the ``type``, ``queue``, and ``factory``
  keys as well as any others as necessary) and the |Queue| object that the edge
  should delivery received messages to::

    def edge_factory(options, queue):
        if 'foo' in options:
            return FooEdge(options.stuff, queue)
        else:
            return BarEdge(options.baz, queue)
