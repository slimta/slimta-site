Edge Services
=============

The term *edge* is not necessarily common among other *MTAs*. It was adapted
loosely by |slimta| from the `Edge Transport Server Role`_ in Microsoft
Exchange, but the name is about where the similarities end.

In |slimta|, an edge service are those that are listening for new messages
entering the system. The protocol does not matter, an edge service produces an
|Envelope| object and hands it off to the next stage of delivery.

Edge services (usually) send their requests to and receive their responses from
a *queue* service. That means the response delivered to the client does not
signify whether the message was successfully delivered, but rather that the
*queue* service has taken responsibility for its delivery.

SMTP Edge Services
""""""""""""""""""

Traditionally, email *MTAs* receive messages from other *MTAs* or user email
clients using the SMTP protocol (`RFC 5321`_, `RFC 2821`_, `RFC 821`_). An SMTP
session delivering a message from a client to a server might look like this,
with server (edge) replies back to the client bolded:

.. parsed-literal::

   **220 slimta.org ESMTP Mail Gateway**
   EHLO client.example.com
   **250-Hello client.example.com**
   **250-8BITMIME**
   **250-PIPELINING**
   **250-STARTTLS**
   **250 ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES**
   MAIL FROM:<sender@client.example.com>
   **250 2.1.0 <sender@client.example.com> Ok**
   RCPT TO:<recipient@server.example.com>
   **250 2.1.5 <recipient@server.example.com> Ok**
   DATA
   **354 Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>**
   ... email data ...
   .
   **250 2.6.0 Message queued as e64820855322425486542d1bd59ba6cd**
   QUIT
   **221 2.0.0 Bye**

SMTP edge services are somewhat unique in that they control not just the receipt
of and response to the message, but also a lot of interim requests. A server may
respond negatively to any command sent to it by the client, and often, crucial
policies are implemented that way. For example, if you are sure you don't want
to accept messages from a certain IP (e.g. known spammers) you would want to
limit the amount of memory and CPU cycles they consume by rejecting before the
before ``DATA``.

Authentication with SMTP Edge
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are a few steps involved with adding authentication to the edge. The first
is exposing the ``AUTH`` SMTP extensions to clients by passing ``auth=True`` to
the :class:`~slimta.edge.smtp.SmtpEdge` constructor.

By default, any credentials will successfully authenticate, so the next step is
adding a :class:`~slimta.edge.smtp.SmtpValidators` class that implements the
``handle_auth`` method::

    from slimta.edge.smtp import SmtpValidators
    from slimta.smtp.reply import invalid_credentials

    class MyValidators(SmtpValidators):
        def handle_auth(self, reply, creds):
            try:
                secret = valid_creds[creds.authcid]
                assert creds.check_secret(secret)
            except (KeyError, AssertionError):
                reply.copy(invalid_credentials)

Finally, we'll want to disallow ``MAIL FROM`` commands until there has been a
successful authentication::

        def handle_mail(self, reply, sender, params):
            if not self.session.auth:
                reply.code = '550'
                reply.message = '5.7.1 Sender not allowed'

If you have not already, you'll need to attach your validators to your
:class:`~slimta.edge.smtp.SmtpEdge` by passing in
``validator_class=MyValidators`` to its constructor.

Proxy Protocol with SMTP Edge
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

When using a TCP proxy in front of |slimta|, it is common to lose information
about the original source address of the connection. The `PROXY protocol`_
adds a header to each connection where the client posts information about the
request's original connection information. To use the proxy protocol::

   from slimta.edge.smtp import SmtpEdge
   from slimta.util.proxyproto import ProxyProtocolV1

   class MyEdge(ProxyProtocolV1, SmtpEdge):
       pass

   smtp = MyEdge(('', 25), queue)
   smtp.start()

Please note, this will cause strange behavior if you are not running |slimta|
behind a proxy that is configured to use `PROXY protocol`_ version 1.

.. _edge-http:

HTTP Edge Services
""""""""""""""""""

A very common desire these days is to be able to submit emails to an MTA using
HTTP or HTTPS protocols, due to the simplicity and ubiquity of these protocols.
Unfortunately, no standards have been settled on, so HTTP mail reception and
delivery can only really be used within controlled environments.

An HTTP session delivering a message from a client to a server might look like
this, with server (edge) replies back to the client bolded:

.. parsed-literal::

    POST / HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
    Host: localhost:8080
    Accept: \*/\*
    Content-Type: message/rfc822
    X-Envelope-Sender: c2VuZGVyQGV4YW1wbGUuY29t
    X-Envelope-Recipient: cmVjaXBpZW50QGV4YW1wbGUuY29t
    Content-Length: 101

    From: sender@example.com
    To: recipient@example.com
    Subject: HTTP mail delivery

    Test message!

    **HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-Smtp-Reply: 250; message="2.6.0 Message accepted for delivery"
    Date: Mon, 29 Jul 2013 20:11:55 GMT
    Content-Length: 0**
