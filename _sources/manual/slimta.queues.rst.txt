Configuring the Queues
======================

With the mail queue being the heart of an MTA, the ``queue`` section of
``slimta.conf`` is both important and highly customizable. It also introduces
the possibility of using the ``slimta-worker`` executable for some queue types.
In the ``queue`` section, each key provides an arbitrary, free-form name for
the queue. The sub-section for each key has two required settings:

* ``type``: String, required

  Defines the type of queue. A known type must be given or an error will be
  thrown. The other keys in this mapping depend on the value of ``type``.

* ``relay``: String, required

  Delivery attempts of messages in the queue are passed to this relay. The value
  is a name, which must correspond to a key in the top-level ``relay`` section.

* ``bounce_queue``: String

  Often when mail is to be relayed locally, the relay is incapable of delivering
  bounce messages to arbitrary sender addresses hosted elsewhere. You may also
  want to apply different retry behavior to bounce messages. This option allows
  you to specify the name of another queue in the top-level ``queue`` section,
  which will be used to deliver bounce messages instead of the current queue.

Queue Policy Settings
"""""""""""""""""""""

On entry into the queue, there are several :doc:`policies` that can be applied
to a message. To configure them, there is an additional, optional key available
in a ``queue`` sub-section:

* ``policies``: List

  Each entry in this list is a dictionary with a ``type`` field. Check out the
  :doc:`policies` page for more information about each type:

  * ``add_date_header``: Adds the ``Date:`` header to the message.
  * ``add_message_id_header``: Adds the ``Message-Id:`` header to the message.
  * ``add_received_header``: Adds a ``Received:`` header to the message.
  * ``recipient_split``: Forks the message so that for each recipient there is
    a deep copy of the original message.
  * ``recipient_domain_split``: Forks the message so that for each unique domain
    in the message recipients there is a deep copy of the original message with
    the recipients for that domain.
  * ``forward``: Rewrites recipients using regular expressions. Along with the
    ``type`` key, there is a ``mapping`` key which is a dictionary of
    replacement rules where each key is a regular expression pattern and the
    value is string to replace the pattern match with.
  * ``spamassassin``: Queries a SpamAssassin server to check if the message is
    considered spam, adding headers to the message with the results.

Delivery Retry Behavior
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Additionally, every ``queue`` type (*except* for ``"custom"`` and ``"proxy"``)
honors the ability to configure message retrying with the following
configuration settings:

* ``retry``: Dictionary

  If this dictionary is *not* given, messages are never retried. This dictionary
  has two keys, ``delay`` and ``maximum``:

  * ``delay``: String
  
    Defines an mathematic expression whose result is used as the number of
    seconds to delay between each delivery attempt of a message.  The string
    allows arithmetic operators and the use of any functions in the :mod:`math`
    module (without the ``math.`` prefix). The variable ``x`` may be used in the
    expression, and will be replaced with the number of delivery attempts the
    message has undergone.

    For example, passing the string ``"300*x"`` will start the delay at five
    minutes, and increase the delay by an additional five minutes for each
    attempt on the message.

    The default value of this setting is ``"300"``, which results in messages
    being retried every five minutes until the maximum number of attempts has
    been reached.

  * ``maximum``: Integer

    Defines the maximum number of retries before a message is failed. If this
    value is not given, messages are never retried.

``memory`` Queues
"""""""""""""""""

With this queue type, all queued messages and their metadata reside in memory.
While this is fast and easy to setup, it is *not* safe for production usage, and
can easily result in loss of mail. The ``"memory"`` queue type does not have any
additional settings.

``disk`` Queues
"""""""""""""""

With this queue type, messages and their metadata are spooled to disk before
acceptance. This queue type requires three directories, which are configured
with the following keys:

* ``tmp_dir``: String

  This directory is used as scratch space so that files can be created and
  written before being moved to their final destination. This allows for the use
  of the atomic :func:`os.rename` operation, to help prevent data corruption. By
  default, the OS-specific temporary directory is used.

* ``envelope_dir``: String, required

  In this directory, the message contents and envelope information are written
  to files that use the ``.env`` suffix in a Python :mod:`pickle` format.

* ``meta_dir``: String, required

  In this directory, the message metadata is kept in files that end in
  ``.meta``. This information is primarily related to the delivery of the
  message, including how many attempts it has undergone, and is kept separately
  so that it can be written to often.

``redis`` Queues
""""""""""""""""

.. _SELECT: http://redis.io/commands/select
.. _AUTH: http://redis.io/commands/auth

With this queue type, messages and their metadata are stored as a hash in a
local or remote redis instance. Additionally, a queue is maintained in redis of
pending new message IDs, meaning this mechanism can receive and deliver messages
across processes. This queue type is configured with the following keys:

* ``host``: String

  This is the hostname of the redis instance to connect to and use as queue
  storage. By default, ``localhost`` is used.

* ``port``: Integer

  This is the port to connect to on the redis instance. By default, ``6379`` is
  used.

* ``db``: Integer

  Upon connection, this is the database number to SELECT_ before doing anything
  else. By default, ``0`` is used.

* ``password``: String

  If given, the AUTH_ command is called with this string before doing anything
  else with the connection.

* ``prefix``: String

  This string is prefixed to every key created by the redis storage engine. This
  can be used to isolate keys from others in the system, to allow for multiple
  redis storage engines to run in the same database, or just to make keys more
  recognizable. By default, ``slimta:`` is used.

``rackspace`` Queues
""""""""""""""""""""

.. _Rackspace Cloud: https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/

This queue type stores messages and their metadata in `Rackspace Cloud`_
services. To do so, it needs the following information:

* ``endoint``: String

  The authentication endpoint used to create an access token and lookup the
  service catalog. This must be the *v2.0* auth API. The default endpoint is
  ``https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/`` which normally is what you
  want to use.

* ``username``: String, required

  The username to pass in to the Rackspace Cloud Auth API.

* ``api_key``: String

  If given, the API key is combined with the username to serve as credentials
  when creating an access token. Either an API key or a password are required.

* ``password``: String

  If given, the password is combined with the username to serve as credentials
  when creating an access token. Either a password or an API key are required.

* ``region``: String

  Used as the default `region
  <https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/about-regions>`_ when
  processing the service catalog.

* ``tls``: Dictionary

  This mapping, which takes the same keys as the keyword parameters to
  :func:`~ssl.wrap_socket`, configures TLS encryption to the Rackspace Cloud API
  endpoints. By default, standard TLS settings are used only when endpoints
  begin with ``https://``.

* ``container_name``: String, required

  The *Rackspace Cloud Files* container name to create storage objects
  containing the |Envelope| and queue metadata.

* ``queue_name``: String

  The *Rackspace Cloud Queues* queue name used by the storage engine. If this
  value is not given, *Rackspace Cloud Queues* will not be used.

``aws`` Queues
""""""""""""""

.. _AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/

This queue type stores messages and their metadata in `AWS`_ services. The
:mod:`boto` library must be installed from *PyPI* to use this queue type. It
takes the following keys:

* ``access_key_id``: String

  Your AWS Access Key ID. If this is not given, the :mod:`boto` library attempts
  to fetch this value from environment variables.

* ``secret_access_key``: String

  Your AWS Secret Access Key. If this is not given, the :mod:`boto` library
  attempts to fetch this value from environment variables.

* ``bucket_name``: String, required

  The *S3* bucket name used to create storage objects containing the |Envelope|
  and queue metadata.

* ``queue_name``: String

  The *SQS* queue name used by the storage engine. If this value is not given,
  *SQS* will not be used.

* ``queue_region``: String

  The *SQS* queue region. By default, ``us-west-2`` is used.

``proxy`` Queues
""""""""""""""""

The ``"proxy"`` queue type is not a queue at all, but rather a method of
bypassing the queue step and immediately attempting message delivery. If
delivery fails, the client gets immediate feedback from the edge service. There
are no additional configuration settings for this queue type.

``custom`` Queues
"""""""""""""""""

Only one additional key is required by the ``"custom"`` queue type:

* ``factory``: String, required

  This is a string of the form ``package.module:symbol``. The package and
  module portion are imported with :func:`importlib.import_module`, and then
  the symbol is fetched from the loaded module with :func:`getattr()`.

  The result of loading the symbol must be a function that takes two arguments,
  the options object (that contains the ``type``, ``relay``, and ``factory``
  keys as well as any others as necessary) and the |Relay| object that the queue
  should use for message delivery::

    def queue_factory(options, relay):
        if 'foo' in options:
            return FooQueue(options.stuff, relay)
        else:
            return BarQueue(options.baz, relay)
