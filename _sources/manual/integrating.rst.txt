Piecing together the building blocks described in previous section is the last
crucial step in setting up your MTA. Nearly everything in |slimta| starts with
an |Edge| service which receives messages. They hand messages off to a |Queue|
service which talks to a |QueueStorage| object to persistently store messages.
The queue initiates delivery attempts with a |Relay| object.

Types of MTA Servers
--------------------

If you read the :doc:`terminology` page, there are `MTAs`_, `MDAs`_, `MSAs`_,
as well as other special configurations like `Smart hosts`_, `SMTP proxies`_,
or `Mail hubs`_. Depending on how you sub-class the different building blocks
of a |slimta| MTA, you can pretty much handle any of these configurations.

 * **MSA**: An MSA is all about taking a message from a mail client like
   Thunderbird and delivering it to its next hop on the Internet. Check out the
   :doc:`msa` page.

 * **MDA**: An MDA takes messages from the Internet and delivers them localy to
   something like `maildrop`_ or `dovecot`_. Check out the :doc:`mda` page.

 * **Smart Host**: A smart host takes messages and delivers them to a specific
   destination, rather then dynamically looking up the recipient's destination.
   Use a :class:`~slimta.relay.smtp.static.StaticSmtpRelay` object.

 * **SMTP proxy**: An SMTP proxy skips the |Queue| altogether, taking |Envelope|
   from the |Edge| and directly attempting delivery with a |Relay| and returning
   the success or failure back to the edge client. SMTP proxies are not yet
   supported by |slimta|, but they are on the radar.

 * **Mail Hubs**: A mail hub is a pretty generic term, but one particular use
   could be a dedicated spam scanner. It receives messages by any |Edge|, calls
   the :class:`~slimta.policy.spamassassin.SpamAssassin` policy, and delivers
   the result to another MTA with a
   :class:`~slimta.relay.smtp.static.StaticSmtpRelay` for further processing.
