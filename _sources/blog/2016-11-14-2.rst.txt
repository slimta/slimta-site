A Little Bit of History
=======================

November 14, 2016

I started this project out of what I saw to be a void in the MTA community. I
had been doing things--terrible things--with Postfix configuration. Things that
deserved to be code, not configuration. What I really wanted was a mail
*library*, not application, so that I could build business logic right into the
system rather than wedging hacks into narrow public APIs.

My `first, failed attempt
<https://github.com/icgood/slimta-deprecated/commit/78ad52868ffac147f36b114a36781a9ca7a64ed8>`_
began in early 2011, using Lua and `homegrown C socket multiplexing
<https://github.com/icgood/ratchet>`_. I `relaunched the project
<https://github.com/slimta/python-slimta/commit/8c0ddf0fac5a741b44c66d6ecb2303acc348c8ac>`_
in late 2012 in Python with gevent, hoping to reach a broader audience and
community. Now, over half-a-decade later, I am very happy that *slimta* is
humming along with a modest user-base and relative stability. It is a project I
am proud of. A huge thank you to everyone who has contributed, from submitting
code, filing a bug report, to simply writing me a note.

If you feel this project deserves it, consider making a small donation.
