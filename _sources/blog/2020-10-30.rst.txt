Extension Consolidation
=======================

October 30, 2020

The release of 4.1.0 took the step of absorbing the following extensions into
the core ``python-slimta`` codebase:

* python-slimta-spf
* python-slimta-lookup
* python-slimta-diskstorage
* python-slimta-redisstorage
* python-slimta-cloudstorage

Maintaining separate repositories, PyPI projects, and CI/CD had become
cumbersome. Simplifying and centralizing was also a factor. The
``python`-slimta`` package now includes a set of "extras" that will install
relevant optional dependencies.

To ease transition, here is a basic mapping of ``pip install`` changes:

* ``python-slimta-spf`` becomes ``python-slimta[spf]``
* ``python-slimta-lookup`` is unnecessary, unless using redis:
  ``python-slimta[redis]``.
* ``python-slimta-diskstorage`` becomes ``python-slimta[disk]``
* ``python-slimta-redisstorage`` becomes ``python-slimta[redis]``
* ``python-slimta-cloudstorage`` is unnecessary, unless using AWS:
  ``python-slimta[aws]``.
